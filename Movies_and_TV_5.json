Slade felt abandoned and betrayed by those he'd loved, and Fonzie was also abandoned by his parents.  Winkler's parents turned their backs on him when he was a young man because he wanted to be an actor instead of following the family business.

Scott and Albert Finney give detailed performances as Scrooge in their version, and the films that feature them have good production values -- and, in the case of the Finney version a couple of good songs -- but the deviations in text in the Scott version and the added material in the Finney version (Scrooge in hell -- what?) are both unnecessary and more than a little annoying.", "summary": "An interesting contrast to more traditional versions", "unixReviewTime": 1008028800}

Yet just fifteen years later, during the Great Depression, he's a very old man.  So what's the deal?  It seems as if the film's producers just happened to have a few WWI-era cars and costumes and posters hanging around, so they decided to twist time around to fit the props.  It doesn't make a whole lot of sense for Winkler's character to be a young boy in what seems to be the early-Industrial Revolution, then a young man during WWI, then a very old man during the Depression.  Very odd.\n\nI have to believe that if they hadn't had some WWI posters and banners and cars available, they would have cut out the War Bond Rally part and kept the continuity intact.  When Slade sees his gravestone, it appears that he was born in 1876- which would make him just over forty in the War Bond scene, and in his mid-fifties in 1933, when the film is supposed to be taking place.  Maybe it's because I'm a history teacher, but this part always bugged me.  Maybe they should have had everyone excited about the Spanish American War of 1898- that would have made a lot more sense, but they would have had to save the scenes with the cars for later. They could have placed the first scene at the end of the Civil War (that would have allowed for some nice props,) making his age in 1933 more believable.

Winkler was at the height of his popularity when this ABC made for TV movie came out so I'm certain that's why he was cast.  Unfortunately you just can't see anything but Fonzie, even under layers and layers of make-up.\n\nThe scene is shifted from 1840's London to  Depression-era New England, as miserly businessman Slade receives a long-overdue attitude adjustment one Christmas eve when he is visited by three ghostly figures who resemble three of the people whose possessions Slade had seized to collect on unpaid loans. Assuming the roles of the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future from Charles Dickens' classic story, the three apparitions force Slade to face the consequences of his skinflint ways, and he becomes a caring, generous, amiable man.\n\nIn a bit of ridiculousness, the \"Ghost of Christmas Future\" is portrayed by a black man wearing gold chains, dressed in 1979 fashions and listens to disco music. Their \"Ghost of the Future\" jumped a little too far ahead, and is comical by todays standards.\n\nWinkler does an admirable job in his role and Dorian Harewood really shines.  Still...Dickens is a classic...why ABC felt a need to revise something so perfect is beyond me.  This is a good change of pace but if you really like \"A CHristmas Carol\" stick with the Alastair Sim or George C.

Murphy", "reviewText": "This film is closer to the Biblical text of this account, than any we've yet seen....it's very emotional and very encouraging as well.  Long film, but not too long!  The only real problem (meaning unacceptable) is the bath-tub scene with Joseph.  He's seen from waist up, in a pool relazing/bathing, and in comes his boss's wife who's been after him sexually.  Potiphar's wife seductively rubs up and down his chest, until (WITH MUSIC AND SOUND EFFECTS GOING ALONG WITH THE SEDUCTIVITY) she goes down into the water below his waist and connects with his genitals (yes, for real).  Both Joseph and her are shown to react to the moment ever so....\"slightly\" and then she leaves him alone until the next time she confronts him.  We had this film for YEARS and thought how awesomely Biblical (compared to any other film) this movie was, but never noticed this part until this year.  Why?  because we had younger children at the time, and so the inferred sexual tension of her rubbing his shoulders over the bath-tub/pool was something we'd simply pass by w/ the fast-fwd button a mere several seconds.  We didn't do that this year, and WHOOOAH!!  We were SHOCKED at what transpired in those few moments.  They don't show below the water, but they PLAY UP the moment big time to let you know what is happening.  For this reason, i say DON'T BUY THE MOVIE unless you can edit it.  If i had this film on VCR, i'd simply tab the \"edit\" tab on the VCR tape and i'd record a whole minute or two over that one moment (which wouldn't hurt a 3-plus hour long film!).\n\nIt's truly a shame that the film makers snuck in a scene of this degree, they simply could have ended with the woman rubbing Joseph's shoulders in flirtation (showing her constant pursuit of him) and played up the moment that way, at that time.  However, they stuck a little leaven in to satisfy Hollywood and to \"leaven the whole loaf\" with making it clear that she was touching his genitals for a bit and he was helpless to deal with the tempation for a few moments.  This cheap move by the film makers reminds me of the \"Sampson\" film put out by the Bible Collection film makers....which is TOTALLY TRASHY...taking the sexuality way OVERBOARD for the Sampson screen (don't buy it!

There were no sexually explicit scenes. There was a scene of Joseph in the bath being tempted by Potiphar's wife. This is no different from a man/woman dealing with sexual thoughts/temptations daily, and that powerful scene would give any Christian in the spirit a visual illustration of the pressure Joseph felt. I especially liked his line when he said to her \"please, you push the limits of my body to more than it can bear.\" The other added scenes did not take anything away from the movie, but gave it dimension. I will take 1 star away only because I do not think that scene where the brother slept with the \"prostitute\" who turned out to be his other brothers wife or whatever was necessary. Besides one or two minor things, overall I thought it was a great film, and the reunion at the end was well acted.\n\nTo the critics harping on sexually explicit, blah blah, gimme a break. There were no sexually explicit scenes in the film. Everything was very \"PG-13\" if not lower. If you call that sexually explicit then you should be censoring Songs of Solomon in the Bible which gives some steamy accounts from Solomon to his \"lover,\" or better yet, you should censor Jesus Christs crucifixion, which was very R-rated (being beaten, flogged, and nailed to a cross seems R-rated to me).

It is a different story, and has nothing to do with the original Frosty TV Special. First of all it is made by a different studio, with different animators, directors, and voices. The director is Bill Melendez, who directed all of the Charlie Brown, Snoopy, and Peanuts specials, so it looks like a Peanuts cartoon. Made in 1992. The voice acting features Jonathon Winters, and it has John Goodman as Frosty. The songs are original and pretty fun. The plot is centered on the folks in town that want clean streets in winter by getting all the snow removed. The kids and Frosty are in a panic and fight back or else they will lose all their snow fun - and snow men. If you approach this show knowing it is not the sequel and is from the team that made the Peanuts shows, you will be OK.\n\nIF YOU ARE ALSO INTERESTED IN THE REAL SEQUEL: The studio that made the first hour long Frosty special that first aired on CBS television in 1969 is Rankin/Bass Productions, the kings of holiday specials. That show was based on the original song written in 1951 by Steve nelson and Jack Rollins. The studio made a terrific half hour sequel in 1976 for ABC television titled \"Frosty's Winter Wonderland\".  That special starts right where the first one left off.  The basic premise of the story is that Frosty gets a wife named Crystal (played by Shelley Winters), and is sabotaged by the jealous Jack Frost. The character design was by Paul Coker Jr., who did the same work for the first special, so the visual continuity works very well and the characters have that classic Rankin/Bass 'look'. He also did the unique lettering for the credits in both specials. The famous voice actor Paul Frees stars as Jack Frost, and the policeman. Frees was a regular in studio productions and had also voiced the policeman, ticket seller, and Santa Claus in the original. Jackie Vernon voiced Frosty just like he did before. The writer for both Rankin/Bass shows was Romeo Muller, and Maury Laws returned as the musical director. Interestingly, while Rankin/Bassis known for the high quality of their original songs, they used Christmas standards in their sequel.  The major change in the sequel from the original is a big one, the narrator, and it can be unsettling if you watch them back to back.  While the first show was narrated and sung by Jimmy Durante, the second time we had the voice talents of Andy Griffith. Nothing against Andy, but it is a big change.\n\nAND ANOTHER SEQUEL: Another sequel of sorts was made by Rankin/Bass with the same production team, it is a theatrical feature length movie released in 1979 titled \"Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July\".", "summary": "Not the real Frosty sequel- see \"Frosty's Winter Wonderland\" for real sequel", "unixReviewTime": 1133827200}

One of them was the stop motion classic Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town.  Nope, I'd never even heard of it before, but I found it pretty fun.\n\nAs the special opens, we run into a mail man (voiced by Fred Astaire) who is delivering letters to Santa.  He decides to tell us all about Santa.\n\nIt starts many years ago when a baby was left in the care of the Burgermeister Meisterburger (Paul Frees).  Being the mean guy that he is, Burgermeister throws the baby out.  But he winds up in the care of a family of elves named Kringle who happen to be toy makers.\n\nThe baby grows into a man named Kris (Mickey Rooney) who decides to deliver the toys that his family makes to share the joy with kids everywhere.  But when he returns to his home village, he finds that the Burgermeister Meisterburger has outlawed all toys.  As a result of defying the ban, Kris becomes a wanted fugitive.  Can he find a way to bring joy to the kids of the village?  And what about the Winter Warlock (Keenan Wynn) who lives between the Kringles and the village?\n\nTo be honest, I wasn't expecting much from this special, and I'm not quite sure why.  Maybe my low expectations were why this one surprised me so much.  I actually got quite caught up in the story even though I had most of it figured out early.  The characters were so great, too, from Kris to his adopted family and his love interest Jessica (Robie Lester) on the good side to the villain you love to hate, Burgermeister Meisterburger.\n\nI'm not a big fan of stop motion animation.  It looks too jerky to me most of the time.  That was certainly the case here, but I actually found it charming.  Maybe I'm softening in my old age.\n\nOne drawback to this short is the music.  Outside of the title song (which Fred Astaire sings so well), all the songs were unfamiliar to me.  Frankly, they didn't add much.  In fact, I found myself wanting to fast forward through them to get back to the story.\n\nNot helping at all was how dated the musical segments were.  This special was released in 1970, and it shows.  I got a definite flower power vibe off the animation during the songs.  There were a couple of other times I felt a bit of that crept into the story.  You might also describe it as psychedelic.  My roommate found this aspect even more annoying than I did; I was mostly able to ignore it and get lost in the story again when it was over.\n\nKids, the target audience, won't notice how dated this is.  In fact, they'll find the 50 minutes over all too quickly.

Fred's a mailman delivering letters from kids to Santa, and he stops to answer some questions in the charming opening credits sequence which quotes most of the musical themes from the 50 minute TV special, first broadcast when I was 5.  Santa was an orphan left on the doorstep of the mean Burgermeister Meisterburger (I still love that name) in Sombretown (ok that's a little corny) with merely the word \"Claus\" on a chain around his neck.  The Burgermeister is a mean old dude and doesn't want him, and through mysterious, fortuitous circumstances he ends up with the Kringle elves in the Mountains of the Whispering Winds.  He grows up learning to make toys, befriends all the animals of the forest, and goes back to Sombretown to give toys to the kids - but is met by the Burgermeister's opposition.  Along the way the reasons for the red suit, the flying reindeer, the belly laugh, etc, are all explained, with the voices of kids breaking into Astaire's narration at times to ask him to verify that this was, in fact, how it happened.  Kinda cool even for this adult.\n\nThis was along with RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER my favorite holiday special as a kid, though it has faded for me somewhat over the years; I guess I remember the romance between Santa and schoolteacher Jessica (Mrs Claus eventually, of course) as more mawkish and sappy than it was, and I'd forgotten that the fairly dreadful \"My World is Beginning Today\" is full of cool 60s hippie/flower people imagery.  The early parts of the story are really fairly dark and bleak, and it's interesting that, though the Burgermeister has a moment where he harks back to childhood, he never reforms and we leave him still villainous, like Potter in IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.  The story - original to this film I think - seems a bit influenced by L. Frank Baum's \"The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus\" in the pagan/natural nature of Santa as we see him early on; but at the end a specifically Christian element enters the picture.  Apart from the love song I already mentioned, the rest of the music is pretty good, with \"Put One Foot In Front of the Other\" probably the most memorable; it still gives me a lump in my throat.\n\nIn addition to Astaire, the voice talents include Keenan Wynn as Winter, the magician who rules the mountains and tries to stop Claus but is quickly befriended by him; professional voice actor Paul Frees as the Burgermeister and others; and Mickey Rooney as Kringle/Santa Claus, a role he would repeat in THE YEAR WITHOUT A SANTA CLAUS.  All are very solid, especially Wynn, an underrated actor and a great vocal talent.  Overall this was definitely more fun than I remembered it from my last viewing, probably a decade ago - though RUDOLPH I suspect will always rule my inner child's heart.", "summary": "Rankin/Bass classic is near the top of their game", "unixReviewTime": 1261612800}

We all agreed some were better presented than others, videos number 2 and 6 stand out as being quite exceptional, but overall every one of the segments had merit.\n\nThe viewer must get used to the format.  Each videos starts out with the host appearing soewhere in the holy land.  Then they transition to a biblical scholar based somewhere in the US.  The host only appears for a couple of minutes at the start of each lesson then plasy no further role.  Once we break away from the host, theme music runs again as if we're beginning something new.  After the second set of theme music the video will cite the Biblical reference then transition to the presenter.  While this all seems a bit odd, it really doesn't detract from the overall presentation.\n\nI recommend this for any Bible study class.  My church offered this as an adult education opportunity but now I've learned it is considering other uses.  I do believe this has many options for general church education.

Our cable provider listed out Holiday shows in the Kids Section during the Season and I found it one year so I got the family together and we watched it. I ended up purchasing it on DVD since it wasn't on the following Christmas and I didn't have Prime at that time. Anyway, on to the review ...\n\nThe show has a couple musical numbers in it which is not a normal feature of the kid's series. They're cute and provide a nice touch. The usual cast of characters are there and we learn a little more about each of them and what they do during their own Holiday celebrations. Every Holiday is covered which has become the norm for many Christmas shows; making sure no one feels left out. As such, you'll learn a little bit about each of those Holidays throughout the vignette of the storyline. Sadly, they keep Christmas focused on the commercial end of it and do not touch upon the sacred core about Christ's birth. But, that isn't distracting or forced, it just is. Arthur's dad does insert a nod to Biblical times when he decides to ditch the usual turkey and taters for first century foods. Neither are the other Holiday celebrations forced into the storyline. They flow naturally and overall the whole show highlights themes such sacrifice, friendship, love, togetherness, etc.\n\nMarc Brown's characters are true-to-life in that he does a fine job having them mirror how kids act in the real world. As such, their reactions provide lots of opportunities to talk to your kids about what is happening during the show. At least, that's how we watch shows. : )\n\nFinal analysis, enjoyable Holiday fare; fun for the whole family.", "summary": "You'll learn some new things about each character and have lots to talk about with your kids", "unixReviewTime": 1382832000}

On the other hand, Example #7 is so much more intricate/difficult than anything else on this disk, it seems out of place.  The best thing on the whole disk are the 2-note per string/string skipping arpeggios (wish I woulda started practicing those 10 years ago). There are a couple of other cool licks, but the video ends up a mess of a lot of talking...my mind wandered.\n\nBefore attempting to play along, you should already know all the major scale modes and the melodic minor scale.  Your alternate picking should already be very controlled/synchronized and you should be experienced with string skipping.  It also contains some extreme finger stretches/intervals that a lot of people might never be able to do (a shorter scale neck or extraordinary long fingers will come in handy here).\n\nIf you don't already have the skills mentioned above, I highly recommend Don Latarski's \"Guitar Theory Basics\" and Frank Gambale's \"Chopbuilder\" be bought first.

There is not a lot of sculpting performed in the practice, although her Yoga routine can provide some toning. She provides very little instruction or beginner options so I would not recommend it if you're looking for a beginner's stretching routine. For instance, during Chaturanga (slow downward movement plank), she does not give the option to lower your knees first, then goes into the full upward dog position. She does bridge pose (an advanced yoga posture) with very little instruction and poor form.\n\nAlso, if you're looking for a non-demoninational practice, this is not the DVD for you. She talks specifically about God, Jesus, and Repenting and includes quotes from the bible during what's called the \"Spritual Warm-Up\", which assumes all spiritual practitioners believe in God and follow the Bible. It felt more like a sermon/lecture to me. This turned me off, specifically since it's marketed as a regular \"stretching\" video.\n\nThe practice is somewhat weak, Tonya's voice is too soft and she does not provide clear enough queues so you have to look up quite often to follow her routine. Moveover, the music is too load and has church-based singing which even more overpowers her delicate voice.\n\nThe introduction video section has Tonya and her single student showing their new babies. It is commendable that they both just gave birth and have made a video. All the proceeds go to \"Acres 4 Life\" which helps people in Africa learn to farm their land, which is awesome! I really appreciate their efforts and work helping people with their loving kindness, but again, it would be better to be straight forward in their marketing that their efforts have religious undertones. It's not that I don't support them, but they should be clear on the cover of the DVD that the proceeds will be used for religious-based projects.\n\nIf you're looking for a couple excellent (non-demoninational) well produced stretching DVD's, I would recommend the following:\nFull Body Stretch by Karen Voight\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Full-Body-Stretch/dp/B00467182C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Full Body Stretch</a>\n\nCool it Off by Mary Schaefer\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Cool-It-Off-Debbie-Siebers-Slim-Series-Stretch-Recovery-Workout-DVD/dp/B000A3XER8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Cool It Off - Debbie Siebers' Slim Series: Stretch/Recovery Workout ( DVD)</a>\n\nTotal Body Stretching by Cathe Friedrich\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Cathe-Friedrich-s-Total-Body-Stretching-DVD/dp/B000B872PC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Cathe Friedrich's Total Body Stretching DVD</a>\nand Stretch Max\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Stretch-Max-with-Cathe-Friedrich/dp/B001E65A8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Stretch Max with Cathe Friedrich</a>\n\nDeep Stretch with Mimi Solaire\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Deep-Stretch-Yin-Yoga-with-Mimi-Solaire/dp/B001JT6Y8S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Deep Stretch/ Yin Yoga with Mimi Solaire</a>\nand Back in Shape\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Back-in-Shape/dp/B0001BRMUE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Back in Shape</a>\n\nSave Your Lower Back with Annetee Fletcher\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Save-Your-Lower-Back-Release-Strengthen-Stretch-with-Annette-Fletcher/dp/B00097C4B2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Save Your Lower Back - Release, Strengthen, Stretch with Annette Fletcher</a>\nand Stretch & Joint Mobility\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Stretch-and-Joint-Mobility-Therapy/dp/B00095MBNK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Stretch and Joint Mobility Therapy</a>\n\nPilates for Flexibility by Amy Brown\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Pilates-for-Life-Pilates-for-Flexibility/dp/B000BNKB14/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Pilates for Life: Pilates for Flexibility</a>", "summary": "Postpartum Yoga-Lite and Prayer", "unixReviewTime": 1339372800}

When he returns home his sister scolds him for his absence. A man catches him alone and asks for a file and food. He is an escaped convict! Back at home he is told to be \"grateful\". Soldiers arrive for the blacksmith, they found the escaped convict and put him in irons. Joe never learned to read. [No schools for common people then.] Pip is cleaned up for a visit. He plays cards with a young girl (pretty and proud). [Does their behavior seem odd?] Pip is questioned about his visit. \"Can this be true?\" He returns in six days for another visit. He sees strange things in that house. When he returns he is given a large sum of money. Afterwards he gets into a fight. [What a strange household!] Pip dreams of a better life. There is conflict in the shop. Later Pip finds a body! Who did it?\n\nLater Lawyer Jaggers tells Pip he has a fortune and will be brought up as a gentleman \"with great expectations\". It's a secret benefactor. Can Joe be compensated for the loss of Pip? Pip gets a new suit and goes to London. They show scenes of life in those days. [To shock the viewer?] Pip's education begins. He lodges at Bernard's Inn. He visits a coworker. He visits Jagger's home and is given a letter. He learns of the death of his sister. Pip visits Miss Haversham again. Pip meets a young lady, they go to a recital. There is a dinner, a toast creates conflict. Pip is jealous of Estella's beau. Pip is in debt, he gets 500 as a birthday present!

There were a lot of close-up shots as you would expect from a movie made for television. Charles Dickens's story tells how riches can make an average man into a gentleman, and no one seems to care as to the origin of these riches. Could someone who becomes wealthy through illegal or unethical means become a respected gentleman? Yes, it has happened many times.

Therefore, my eyes are just as content to watch the 1981 version, which develops the characters much better (even if it drags on at times.)\n\n- This production does not develop Orick's character, or Estella's character early in the production. In fact, Mr. Pumblechook and other characters are also not as developed as I would have wished.\n\n- Dickens' novel drags on in the middle. This production greatly contracts the plot in the central half of the novel. For example, Bentley Drummel and Matthew Pocket's characters are not developed very well in the middle part of this work. Matthew's father is nearly eliminated.\n\n- This words spoken in this production have been updated from the 1981 adaptation and the novel. In fact, the 1974 adaptation is more accurate than this 1999 production as pertains to including famous quotes from the novel.\n\nOne positive of this adaptation is that the mood (the psychology) of this adaptation is better than the 1981 version or any other version I have seen. A second positive is that the acting is this production is just as good as the 1981 adaptation.\n\nIn summary:\nI prefer the 1981 version best (even though I would only give it a 4 star). However, this production is better than the 1974 Michael York/Sarah Miles adaptation, which completely eliminates the character of Orlick.\n\nFor people who want a film to watch for pleasure (rather than to prepare for a major content examination), this adaptation may be the most interesting and best choice. Otherwise, I would recommend the much longer 1981 adaptation.", "summary": "An average production....", "unixReviewTime": 1243468800}

Here she plays an attractive woman, who has been raised by her jilted, grandmother to intentionally misuse and abuse men, who are infatuated with her beauty. She plays this part effectively as you feel the young man's emptiness in the end. However, I could not get into this version\n\nThe 1981-version has a better first episode; but then drags.\n\nThe book's author, Charles Dickens, married his wife Catherine in 1836. They were together 21-years, and had ten children. During his marriage Dickens wrote his brilliant novels: \"Oliver Twist\" 1839, \"A Christmas Carol\" 1843, and \"David Copperfield\" 1850. Mr. Dickens divorced his wife in 1858. Mr. Dickens wrote the story \"Great Expectations\" after his divorce in 1861. Divorce affects everyone no matter the circumstances. The 1947-version of \"Great Expectations\" is a good movie, but I did not like the part about the jilted, bitter, wealthy, old, grandmother; living in the dark, big house; with the dining-room and food left untouched for 50-years. Yet, if you persist through these strange scenes; the 1947-version is interesting later on in the film. I realize this woman is a necessary part of the story, but the film should have been much briefer with her.\n\nCharles Dickens's book \"Oliver Twist\" is wordy, long, and daunting, unless you are a strong and imaginative reader. The \"Oliver Twist\" DVD is great for the rest of us, because the story has been so polished and streamlined by so many people. Before TV and movies; before radio, every town had a theatre that performed plays. Every town in England and America performed the play \"Oliver Twist\"; for 90-years, until sound movies. For 90-years; these towns kept polishing the story and improving upon each other. Today; on DVD, the polished story skips along without a bump. The story \"Great Expectations\" did not get this polishing in the theatre and has a few bumps.

I really enjoy historical dramas, especially BBC tv series. In this Great Expectations, the acting was good, especially the heartless little Estella. However, what I didn't like about the movie:\n1. Too much scenery, not enough interaction. Instead of 10 seconds of Pip walking on the moors, we get 30 seconds. The same goes for birds flying, waves on the water, Pip walking through dark tunnels, Pip walking through dark streets, Pip walking up stairs, Pip rowing a boat. Pip opening doors and walking down dark hallways. Lots of extended scenes of scenery and no character conversations. Also, there're lots of scenes of Pip and Miss Haversham, Joe and the convict. But, there's next to no scenes of Pip and the love of his life, the grown-up Estella. Which leads to the next point:\n2. As a result of the lack of scenes with Pip and Estella, we hear secondhand that she's unhappy, and we only hear Pip say that he's in love. The editing/screenplay is so choppy that we never hear why or how. I guess we are to assume from 10 minutes of the movie that Pip loves her madly because she is pretty and treats him very cooly.\nI mean, honestly, we get what's got to be a total of 30 minutes of boring scenery in the movie, and then almost none of the adult Pip falling in love with Estella, or what happens to Estella after marriage?\n3. Discontinuity. I don't understand why Estella is so heartless and cruel as a child, then comes back as a soft mannered, kindly seeming lady. Is this a gentleman-trap of some sort?\nI give this 2 stars because the acting was very good, but the storyline is super choppy, cryptic, and unbalanced.

As if to resist the Americanized version starring Ethan Hawke made the year before, this film version, as far as I know, is the least romantic one ever made.  Whether or not you like the film solely depends on this aspect, so let me tell you about it first.\nThe story is comparatively faithfiul, spending about 3 hours to cover the story of Pip, an apprentice of blacksmith who unwisely perhaps, falls in love with cold-hearted Estella.  But the film, as I said, gives more stress on darker side of the book, so the love theme is not explored as deep as other versions such as David Lean's or Alfonso Cuaron's.  Rather, the newer version seems to give more emphasis on the Pip's guilty feelings deep rooted in his contact with the runaway convict Magwitch, and the film's way of shooting the famous opening of the book, which relates their encounter on the graveyard in the marshes, gives us no time for savoring Dickensian humor.  The film uses the technique of flash-back, in order to express Pip's fear, which, I am afraid, is overdone for its own sake.\nI do not follow every details of the story (you probably have read the book), but I have to say this; like I said, this film is endowed with least amount of humor and romance.  Sure, you see Wemmick's most casual wedding; you see Biddy, Joe, Herbert (not all Pockets however), but you cannot expect to find any humorous scnes, one of Dickens' trademarks.  So, when Pip recounts how he met Miss Havisham before his sister and Pumblechook, he is literally forced to talk.  As you know, this is one of the humourous scenes of the original -- even though the humor is downplayed -- where we can see Pip makes up his own story, which gets more and more outrageous as he goes on.  But the director here didn't seem to see that way, depicting the whole incident as simply terrifying one for Pip, who must receive as much scolding and harsh words from them, as if in a tortune.\nJustine Waddle, often cast in costume dramas, is good as grown-up Estella, but before she could show something, the film goes on to follow the story of Pip, who must face bravely several darker moments of life (you know what I mean -- Orlick and Themes River), thus making least use of romance between Pip and her.  Actually, the film shows more of mud (of London and Pip's village) and decay, so the first thing Pip sees in London is the butchered cattles hanging on the hook.  It is true that Dickens' original book tells how Pip, arriveing in London for the first time in his life, wanders around Smithfield, then an open-sir cattle market, but ... do we need to know that?\nThe portrayal of Gruffudd's grown-up Pip is so-so, but the most disappointed thing about the film is Charlotte Rampling's Miss Havisham.  Not that her acting is bad, but her Havisham simply does not convince me, being too weak in her gestures.  She should be more authentic as this witch-like woman often found in fairy tales, who commands people, not just talks.  If she does not follow the flamboyant acting of Anne Bancroft, that is OK.  I just need more enticing mystery in this enigmatic, willful woman, Havisham.\nOverall not bad if you look for bleak atmosphere in Dickens.  But for those who seeks for humor and romance in him, this is not the one to see.", "summary": "Beautifully Shot But the Least Romantic and Humorous Version", "unixReviewTime": 1045526400}

Some solid bonus content adds value. The nice hi-def transfer helps make this a marginal recommend. 3 STAR film, 4 STAR Blu-ray\n\nTHOUGHTS: With a couple of top-notch stars like this film has, it should have been a singular masterpiece. Instead, the scattershot screenplay has so many inconsistencies and head-scratching lapses in logic that it makes what otherwise could have been a great motion picture merely an interesting diversion. For instance: these guys spend how many months/years together, and yet neither one bothers to learn at least some of the other fellow's language? Basic communication is essential to increase the odds of survival and/or rescue, not to mention simply making their co-existence more bearable. Instead, they spend the film's entire running time screaming at one another in their native tongue. For cryin' out loud, they never even bother to learn each other's names! Really?!? Sorry, not buying it. Totally unrealistic. There's also a very unfocused transition as they go from enemies who first try and kill each other, then just try to annoy each other, then capture one another and torture the other guy... to just suddenly being too exhausted to fight, so they become tolerant acquaintances. Huh??? The downbeat ending is a nice try at poignant irony, but also falls flat in its execution. (The alternate ending, equally as depressing, isn't much better.) Again, I blame ALL of this film's problems on its script, which should've had another two or three passes, at the minimum, in order to eliminate the annoying incongruities and make the narrative flow better. Both actors are excellent, the direction is steady & solid, the cinematography is outstanding and the minimalist musical score is good. However, none of that can overcome a bad script and HELL IN THE PACIFIC has a muddling, mediocre script - at best.\n\nTHE BLU-RAY: Now the good news for fans of this film. The hi-def release of HELL IN THE PACIFIC sports a really nice transfer. The picture is crisp & clean, with solid blacks, strong mid-tones, and not much in the way of artifacting, pixelation or crush (video noise). The original film grain is also wonderfully evident, (no DNR tampering/overscrubbing!). The audio portion is clear and the soundmix is level. There are a half dozen or so bonus features, including interviews with the director and the art director, and a full-length audio commentary track, which help make this Blu-ray a solid bargain. If you love this film, this Blu-ray is a must-own. Casual viewers will still find much to admire, and lots of beautiful scenery to hold their attention.

Taking that stereotype and coupling it with that of a ruthless and bold criminal was unique. The notion that the viewer saw the caricature as always failing, yet the charactor himself did not perceive himself that way, was a refreshing way of telling a story.

Telling the story of two pilots, one Japanese (Toshiro Mifune) and one American (Lee Marvin), stranded on a small, deserted tropical island during World War II it's at once fascinating and somewhat flat.  Mifune and Marvin are two of my favorite actors.  Their plight on the island, coveting or guarding precious limited resources against the `enemy', more or less drives home the point that war is a futile exercise.  Of course the question arises as to whether we can conquer our distrust before we conquer, or are conquered by, our enemy.  HELL IN THE PACIFIC is thought-provoking and beautifully photographed by master cinematographer Conrad Hall.\n\n  After a while, though, with all the attacks and counter-attacks, I got the feeling that I was in the middle of a Road Runner cartoon with no exit.  This feeling was exacerbated by such scenes as Marvin trying to teach captive Mifune (the balance of power changes a number of times) to fetch a stick like a dog.  It was an ill-conceived scene, brutishly funny if the intent was humor, but added onto the ridiculous ending HELL IN THE PACIFIC seems to have expended its creative energy well before the final credits run.  By the way, I strongly recommend watching the `Alternate Ending' in the Special Features after watching the movie.

You will be enthralled with the wonderful acting and really care for these two characters. Then to suddenly watch their lifes snuffed out just so some writer or director could make their point that war is bad didn't impress me. If someone didn't think we get that point long before the ending of this movie, they don't give much credit to the audience.

This fitfully funny 1969 comedy marks Allen's feature film debut as a triple threat - director, writer (with early partner Mickey Rose) and star, and it shows the earmarks of his later visual style even if the laughs are not always there.\n\nLacking an actual storyline, the movie takes us through Starkwell's life from shoplifting bubblegum machines as a youngster to bank robberies to finding the ideal woman to prison and so on and so on. This is Allen at his purest with focus on often hilarious sight gags and self-deprecating one-liners without his later forays into the complexities of the human condition. In fact, this is probably the only time that Allen has played a screen character without any intellectual pretensions. The closest he comes is pretending to be a cellist with the Philharmonic to the girl of his dreams, a pretty laundress named Louise. The best gags are probably the prison shirt-folding machine, the bank robbery where Starkwell's badly handwritten note is passed around the staff to interpret, the escaped chain gang coming into the old woman's house, the prison vaccine experiment that turns Starkwell into a Hassidic rabbi, and my favorite, the totally impossible scene where he drives a car inside a blackmailing woman's house chasing her around.\n\nOf less interest is the romance between Starkwell and Louise, who is portrayed as self-conscious and rather mealy-mouthed. Allen's usual generosity with actresses has not yet developed at this point, and Janet Margolin is forced to play Louise quite passively despite her beauty. For a movie that is supposed to take place between the 1940's through the early 1960's, it certainly looks and feels like hippie-era 1969, especially with the Austin Powers-style music over the chase scenes. Allen's first wife Louise Lasser (yes, Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman) has a funny cameo as an early girlfriend.

Check out some of the other reviews here, which recount a few of the better sight gags and funny scenarios to see what I mean.  Just be warned, though, that Woody still had a way to go before the jokes got really sharp and the storylines moved with supreme smoothness.  I don't want to overstate the criticism, as \"Take the Money and Run\" never sinks to boredom, or choppiness in the story telling.  It's just that Woody's best period was still three or four films ahead of him at this point and a certain lack of polish is still evident.  But the movie is still definitely worth a look, even though I'm not as big a fan of it as some other folks.\n\nUnfortunately, the full-frame version of \"Take the Money and Run\" is the one most easily available on DVD in this country.  On the plus side, however, I noticed no obvious and offensive cropping of the image while I watched the movie (though I guess something must have been cropped somewhere to create the full-frame image).  Also on the plus side, the print is sharp, clear, and bright.\n\nBut, alas, like most DVDs of Woody's films, there are basically no extras, just a trailer.  But we've come to expect that from Mr. Allen, haven't we?

It is this wry commentary that lends the film its pseudo-documentary flavor, and the plot is pretty much a patchwork of such clips and thus not exactly awash with consistent humor. Certain scenes are pretty funny though, e.g., the protagonist's escape attempt at the prison that involved a bar of soap and some shoe polish, or a bizarre incident with a chain gang, etc.\nFor Allen fans, it's a no brainer: you'll see it anyway.

Its only real value is as a curiosity.\nThis is Woody establishing his template for later movies, i.e., nebbishy loser, a failure at his chosen occupation, acquires an impossibly beautiful girlfriend, and tries to do right.\nThe mockumentary style he chooses to utilize for the most part works nicely. At times, though, its tone feels uneven, floating from documentary to narrative fiction and back to documentary. If he had stuck to one style the power of the satire would be much stronger. And now that I think of it, choosing to do an obviously mannered genre parody with your first film is somewhat dubious. It sent him on a path that would lead to the well-meaning but uneven films \"Bananas\" and \"Sleeper\". Not till \"Love and Death\" would he make a film where the parody serves the story rather than the story serving the parody.\nWhile most of the jokes feel forced, there are some truly hilarious proto-Woody moments. The marching band scene (with Woody gamely trying to keep up while tugging along his cello and a chair) knocked me down flat with laughter. And a moment late in the film, with Woody trying to conduct a substantive interview with a rambling subject (Woody keeps saying \"Get to the point\" from behind the camera), is a most effective moment in terms of parodying the documentary form. But other than these, and few others, I was disappointed by the humour. A running gag, where Woody's glasses repeatedly get stomped on by authority figures, was flat the first time I saw it and got flatter each subsequent time.\nThis film is definitely at the bottom of my personal list of favourite Woody Allen movies. It may be because I prefer his dexterous verbal wit to the juvenile sight gags and physical humour he employs here, or that he had yet to find his footing with this, his first outing.

And made poorly it is. The score is over-blown & barely fits within a scene, the dialogue is atrocious, the acting is embarrassing to all involved, the plot is convoluted as all get out, and there isn't a single genuinely good moment to be found.\n\nFirst off, tone. I've never been more baffled as to what the filmmakers were going for than I was with this film. It didn't really strike me as serious, but it never struck me as a comedy or a parody either, or even campy. I've never seen the TV series, but my god, I don't think it had people dressing up in Teddy bear costumes! That's right, Sean Connery, and a bunch of other people in a board room wear teddy bear suits. Why? So they don't know who each other is. Why teddy bear suits? I have no earthly idea. In a way, it's sort of charming in the way \"Toys\" was with Robin Williams and that crazy world, but any charm is zapped by the utter incomprehensibility injected scene, after scene, after painful scene. Sean Connery gets a cane stuck through him, then lightning comes down, zaps him, and then carries him up. Why didn't this lightning bolt strike before? I mean, Sean Connery had the cane with him the whole time.\n\nThen there's the casting. Forget the fact that this is basically Mr. Freeze with weather puns instead of ice puns, and it's being said by the great Sean Connery, the real offender of this film is Uma Thurman. Yes, Uma was in Batman & Robin also, so bad picking skills on her part, but my gosh is she miscast. The actress is from Boston, but the character is from England, and speaks in an English accent, and boy does it show. Oh wait, she also gets to fight her clone named \"Evil Peel,\" and gets to say the line, \"You just saved me from myself.\" Yes, that's actual dialogue from this movie. And that's one of the \"funnier\" lines. As for Ralph Fiennes, I don't believe he's actually in the film. It's actually Joseph in Ralph's face, because that's the quality he puts into this. Granted, his character basically gets to fight with umbrellas, drink tea, and speak in a polite British accent, but my gosh, put a little emotion into it!\n\nIt's rumored that 50 minutes was cut out of this film right before release, sacrificing a lot of the coherentness to make it a bad movie. Believe me, it was always a bad movie. There's no amount of extra scenes that could make this even a decent movie. It's at its core a bad film. What, are you going to have dialogue explaining why Steed & Peel come to Wynter's fortress in plastic bubbles? Are you going to have dialogue explaining the need to create mechanical bees? The list goes on and on, and in the end, it would have just prolonged the awfulness. As is, it's too long. So stay away from these Avengers at all costs, and go watch those other Avengers.

Thus the Weinsteins chose not to restore The Fall of the Roman Empire, MGM/UA chose not only to ignore the existing four-hour rough-cut version of Tony Richardson's The Charge of the Light Brigade but actually put out a cut version of the theatrical version and the much-troubled 1998 movie version of The Avengers will never be seen as it was originally intended. It's not the catastrophe its often portrayed, but the studio only had themselves to blame for the over-reaction by violating the quid-pro-quo relationship with the press by not screening it for the critics, a public relations disaster that lead to many publications imposing a blacklist on articles about their films for months after and picking it as their turkey of the year.\n\nWarner Bros. 75th anniversary year was certainly not good one, with flop after flop turning their planned celebrations into commiserations. Perhaps in any other year there would have been less pressure on trying to turn an always optimistically surreal cult item into a blockbuster despite increasingly bad word of mouth, but by the time it emerged from lengthy post-production, the film was covered from head to toe in self-inflicted wounds. What had started out with a two-hour plus running time went to a 101-minute compromise cut to a released version that ran only 81 minutes without credits with Michael Kamen's original score replaced by a quickie effort from Joel McNeely as they tried to unsuccessfully make it more conventional to an audience unfamiliar with the series while alienating the original fans. It's just a surprise they didn't try to edit it down further to the length of a TV episode - even the troubled movie version of The Saint only lost its last 20 minutes. In the process they simply turned an interesting misfire into a much shorter, more confusing misfire and ended up with something too surreal for mainstream audiences, and too mainstream for Avengers fans. (The BFI was offered the chance to screen and preserve the original cut in 1999, but all too typically blew it by not bothering to return the studio's calls!)\n\nThe loss of the original (and heavily trailered) opening was certainly a huge mistake. Instead of seeing Mrs Peel (or is it?) breaking into and destroying a weather station, something that triggers the plot (a variation on both the original show's A Surfeit of H20 and Our Man Flint with a weather-controlling eccentric millionaire holding the world to ransom), the film now opens with Steed taking on policemen, milkmen and machine-gun toting nannies with only his bowler and brolly - an enjoyable enough introductory scene but not as essential to understanding what's going on. That's just the first of many plot holes the film is left with, but they're still the least of the film's problems.\n\nOn the plus side, Ralph Fiennes wisely doesn't attempt a Patrick McNee impersonation as Steed, opting for a more formal, slightly reserved approach that lacks Macnee's effortless bonhomie but works well enough on its own terms. Jim Broadbent makes a good `Mother' and Eileen Atkins (in a cameo originally intended for Diana Rigg) effortlessly steals her few scenes. But if they're all on good form, just about everyone else isn't. Indeed, there's miscasting on an epic scale here - Fiona Shaw overacting for England yet again as `Father,' Eddie Izzard exuding all the menace of a fluffy kitten and Uma Thurman delivering a turn bad enough to make you sorry they didn't cast Elizabeth Hurley as Mrs Peel instead. You feel almost sorry for her and wonder how she ever got another job after this - she can't do comedy, she can't do the accent, she can't do sophisticated, she can't do the banter and most of her action scenes hit the cutting room floor, which reduces her to not much more than a clotheshorse. That there's absolutely no chemistry between her and Fiennes is just another nail in the coffin.\n\nSadly it's a performance more than matched by what originally seemed the film's great casting coup. Sean Connery, once again showing the keen commercial instinct that led him to turn down X-Men, Lord of the Rings and The Mask of Zorro, gives a career-worst performance in his first role as a villain since 1959's Tarzan's Greatest Adventure and 1984's Sword of the Valiant. Looking like Windsor Davies playing a dirty old man but without the restraint, his introductory single-entendre scene with Thurman is painful to watch as she flounders and he mistimes every line - it's the kind of thing you'd expect in a Robbie Moffat film where amateur actors only get one take and it goes in the picture whether they fluff it or not. It cannot be stressed enough just how absolutely awful he is for much of the film, and considering how often Connery's double stood in for him Peter Sellers-style even on non-action scenes because of the star's feuds with the director and producer (shades of LXG) you find yourself wondering if his better moments may not even be him.\n\nThere's a lot about it that's good - the teddy bear scene is spot on and worthy of the original show while Patrick McNee's cameo non-appearance is fun - and a lot that isn't - Roger Pratt's dour photography overcompensates for the primary colors of Stuart Craig's production design and Anthony Powell's costumes. Yet while it's a mess that often stops making sense thanks to the unsubtle re-editing, it's still surprisingly watchable, with just enough moments that do work and give a hint of what could have been to keep you soldiering on through the patches that fall flat. It's just a shame we'll probably never see the film the way it was originally intended to judge it on its own merits rather than the studio's second-guessing.\n\nNot much in the way of extras here - just  a  trailer  and som e  text notes - though the disc does have an acceptable widescreen transfer.", "summary": "Not a catastrophe but certainly a mess", "unixReviewTime": 1232755200}

The bear suit was not his finest hour...although pretty funny.\n\n And I also have to wonder just why when casting this, the \"supporting\" role of henchman (with no lines) was given to a stand up comedian, Eddie Izzard. Known for being a non-stop talker. But of course for the one and only cuss word for the whole movie...and I swear that it's not Eddie Izzard's voice in the first place, just a dubded in word.\n\n So finely, this movie does get a star because the location shots are not bad.

I was curious see if the movie still came across as bad to me as it did when I originally saw it theatrically. Did it??? Please continue reading......\n\nOn the surface, The Avengers seemed to have all the required ingredients for a surefire summer blockbuster. You had plenty of star power in the form of Sean Connery, Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes. There was a 60 million dollar budget to spend and the movie was based on a 60's cult british secret agent series of the same name that had a dedicated and pretty sizable cult following. You also had Uma Thurman strutting around in an extremely tight leather body suit. Everything seemed initially in place to deliver an updated 90's theatrical version that could have been a cool/fun alternative to the James Bond films. But what ended up in theaters was the biggest bomb of the summer of 1998 (and of the whole year for that matter) and one of the worst films ever released by a major studio.\n\nIn its theatrical form, The Avengers was a jumbled, murky and incoherent mess that made hardly any sense no matter how hard you tried to figure out what exactly was going on. My friends and I saw it for free back in 1998 despite the fact that it had not been screened for critics (always a terrible sign) and left the theater with a very bad headache, wondering what in the hell we had just been subjected to. The worst sin that this movie commited was that besides the bizarre teddy-bear costumes (I'll get back to those later on!) this movie isn't even enjoyable on a so-bad-it's-good level.\n\nThe basic plot involves, more or less, an evil madman called Sir August de Wynter (Sean Connery) who has built a new weather-controlling device. The British government who has been watching his actions for quite some time. They send two of their secret agents, John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) and Emma Peel (Uma Thurman), to investigate what Sir August is up to and to thwart whatever attempts that he is making for world domination.\n\nAfter the initial introductions to the two secret agents, they begin to check out Sir August's true plans and wherabouts. The movie quickly turns into a series of badly edited action scenes that fall flat every time and a series of scenes that literally make no sense at all in the grand scheme of things.\n\nA perfect example is when John and Emma are traveling in their souped up car near the beginning (complete with a mini-coffee maker/bar), they are suddenly chased by giant remote control robotic bees. They eventually git rid of the pests, but after exiting their car it explodes for literally no reason at all. One of our first glimpses of Sir August involves a sort of meeting with some people to show off his new weather-control device. For some inexplicable reason, everyone is wearing giant multi-colored teddy-bear costumes! It truly must be seen to believed and if the rest of the movie had been as over-the-top and campy as this scene it would have been entertaining on a purely guilty pleasure level. But unfortunately, the rest of the film has the same flat and lifeless feel to it that the opening scenes exhibit.\n\nThere's also a completely unexplained subplot involving a clone of Uma Thurman running around that culminates with the real and fake Uma's batteling it out in a poorly choreographed fight in a very slow moving hot air balloon. Actually, that's this movie's biggest problem. Almost everything that happens seems unfinished and unexplained. There are some huge gaps in logic that will surely have any unsuspecting viewer screaming for someone to cut it off.\n\nI read a while back that the original rough-cut of the movie that was test-screened with disasterous results was a little under 2 1/2 hours. Warner Bros. then demanded that the filmmakers cut the film down considerably, which they grudgingly obliged. The producers stated that the revised cut they turned in came in at 101 minutes with credits and they were actually happy with that cut. But Warner Bros. then proceeded to cut an additional 12 minutes from the film and the result was 89 minutes of terrible action scenes and no plot and logic. Do I think that the original cut would be better? It might certainly make considerably more sense, but the movie would still be awful due to some huge problems.\n\nThe acting all around is atrocious. Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman have absolutely no chemistry whatsoever. Ralph is stoic and just looks bored. Uma goes through the movie in a variety of tight outfits (including the previously mentioned leather body suit), but her efforts at a believable british accent are laughable. She tries her best but it is very evident that she was not comfortable with her role and the script in any way. The rest of the cast just seems embarassed to be in this movie.\n\nThe film will probably gain some sort of cult status based purely on Sean Connery's over-the-top yet terrible performance. I thought that his efforts came across as way too forced and I've always wondered if he did this movie just to pay some back-taxes or a sizable poker debt. He's been in some bad movies before, but he's still managed to turn in a solid performance (Medicine Man and Entrapment for instance). But in this movie, he's just awful in every respect.\n\nSpecial effects are laughable throughout with some particularly hilarious matte and model work during the film's climax involving a hot air balloon traveling at about 5 miles an hour and some awful CGI tornadoes tearing up an equally bad replica of London. The final battle between Ralph and Sean is also very reminiscent of Highlander 2 for some reason (in terms of how bad it is choreographed and edited).\n\nI'm not sure what Warner Bros. was thinking with this one. But then again, they did the exact same thing with 1999's equally terrible Wild Wild West (which at least made back most of its budget). While I haven't seen many of the original 60's episodes that this was based, it initially seemed that this had some great potential to be a fun little secret-agent/spy movie, but the execution was botched from all angles. It is clear that everyone involved was hoping for an alternative to the James Bond franchise, but this movie immediately squashed any chance of that. The marketing campaign seemed to focus on Uma Thurman in that tight leather body suit, but even that isn't enough to recommend sitting through this migraine inducing disaster.\n\n(On the DVD front, I'm surprised that Warner Bros. didn't include the ton of cut footage from the original version as deleted scenes. It would have really helped to shed some light on what went wrong with this movie. Much to my surprise, there is actually a cult following for this film that have been petitioning Warner Bros. for quite some time to release the original 2 1/2 version, or at the very least the second 101 minute producer's cut. It's scary to think that some people actually liked this movie!)\n\nThe Avengers is rated PG-13 and contains violence and language.", "summary": "Terrible in every way.", "unixReviewTime": 1130976000}

This requires a bit of historical perspective. Britain in the early/mid-1960s was a culture in which long-accepted norms were threatened by powerful social forces. The youth movement was forever redefining attitudes toward authority and government, Britain was birthing a type of music that would soon sweep the world, and, particularly important to The Avengers, the women's rights movement saw many a woman demand more from her future than a lifetime of housewifedom.\n\nWhen Diana Rigg's character of Emma Peel was first introduced to The Avengers in 1965, the show had already been going for several years. The character of John Steed was well-established as a conservative, stiff upper lipped, tea drinking, bowler hatted, ex-military, prime example of upper crust middle-aged traditional British masculinity. Then along came his new partner Emma Peel: young, irreverent and outspoken, sexually aggressive, dressed in provocative mod fashion AND possessed of four doctorates. Bear in mind, at this time in Britain it was almost unheard of for a woman to be a doctor at all. Not only did Emma Peel defy that convention, she did it times four.\n\nTo John Steed, exemplar of the-way-things-are-and-should-be, Emma Peel was the living embodiment of forces threatening to destroy everything he held dear, everything to which he'd devoted his life, his duty, his sacred honor. To Peel, Steed was the sort of hidebound reactionary she'd been fighting against her entire life in order to be the sort of woman, the sort of whole person her sense of individuality demanded. The great thing about the John Steed/Emma Peel Avengers episodes was watching these two very different people, each representing social forces the other had every reason to despise, over time learn to value and respect what the other had to offer, eventually even to love each other. An endless source of debate among Avengers TV fans is whether or not Steed and Peel's relationship ever became sexual or was simply platonic. Whichever opinion you embrace, there can be no doubt the love and respect were there.\n\nThe Avengers TV show was profoundly fortunate in its casting of John Steed and Emma Peel. Patrick Macnee perfectly portrayed the somewhat stuffy, exceedingly proper man of action. The heart of a noble knight in a three-piece suit and bowler hat. But as good as Macnee was, Diana Rigg's casting as Emma Peel was the masterstroke. For Emma Peel to accomplish everything she had in life before ever meeting John Steed, she must have been a high-level genius. Fortunately for the show, in real life Diana Rigg has an IQ that looks like a zip code, as well as immense class, polish, sex appeal, a strong will, and the thespic skills of a successful Shakespearean actress. When Diana Rigg played a high-level genius with multiple doctorates it was believable. I can't imagine anyone else who could have portrayed Emma Peel so well.\n\nSo that's why the original Steed/Peel episodes of The Avengers rocked. And that's why the movie is a failure, because it has none of that going for it. It could be argued the social milieu within which the TV series existed, that provoked and informed its subtext, no longer exists and so the movie couldn't have used it anyway. Maybe. But I see no evidence the moviemakers were even aware of it. The props are there, the surface accoutrements, Steed's umbrella and bowler hat, Peel's catsuit, but the conflicts and dynamic that drove the original relationship and made it something truly special are nowhere to be found.\n\nThe casting in a problem. Ralph Fiennes tries hard but is hideously miscast. He's too young, too contemporary looking, to portray a rock-ribbed conservative like John Steed. Uma Thurman, though I respect her as an actress, was similarly a poor choice to play Emma Peel. From watching Uma Thurman in interviews I get a sense of her as an intelligent, thoughtful human being, but she simply can't convincingly portray a high-level genius like Emma Peel. Thurman's Peel is more coquettish than intellectual. When Diana Rigg says she has four doctorates you buy it. When Uma Thurman says the same thing, you can't.\n\nThere are other reasons to dislike this movie, but none as important as those just discussed. A great television show does not necessarily translate to a great movie when those making the latter fail to understand what made the former great, and the two leading roles are horribly miscast. If you want to enjoy The Avengers, check out the Patrick Macnee/Diana Rigg originals, and give this turkey a pass.", "summary": "Great TV Show, Lousy Movie", "unixReviewTime": 1090627200}

Sean Connery is one of my favorite actors and I was looking forward to seeing him as a villan. Uma Thurman is one of the sexiest women in movies today and I wanted to see her take on Diana Rigg's Mrs. Peel. And Ralph Finnes has been in several of my favorite films, including Schindler's List and Quiz Show. However, they all fall flat in this film (although Thurman looks great in her Mrs. Peel leather outfit).\nThe film tries to recapture the odd flavor of the series (the Connery board meeting in which all the participants are dressed as teddy bears, for example), but falls flat every time. Finnes is miscast as John Steed (too young) and he and Thurman have none of the chemistry that Diana Rigg and Patrick Macnee had in the original series.\nDo yourself a favor. Instead of buying this waste of precious natural resources, buy the DVD set of the Emma Peel episodes of the original series. Then rent the DVD of this film -- you'll quickly see that newer, in this case, is definitely not better.", "summary": "UGH!", "unixReviewTime": 1023753600}

I think Ralph Fiennes is a fine actor and whats more I'm Scottish and as is the custom if you're Scottish, I'm one of Sir Sean Connery's greatest fans. He was the best Bond (although Pierce Brosnan's doing a fine job) and great in movies such as The Hill, The Untouchables (even if the accent was a bit ropey), The Hunt For Red October, The Rock, Outland etc. He is a fine ambassador for his nation and the world's greatest living Scotsman by popular acclaim BUT what were you thinking Sir Sean when you made this pile of poo? Didn't you read the script? Or were you too busy banking the cheque?\nThis movie stinks. Not because a remake of the sixties TV series was a bad idea because it wasn't. Not because the movie didn't have potential because it did. Not because the series had a cult following and the movie had a ready made audience to tap into. No it stinks because it boasts one of the worst scripts ever, with plot-holes you could drive a car through, poor editing, poor special effects, a really (...) supporting performance from Eddie Izzard and perhaps the worst choreographed and directed action scenes you could ever see. Take a bow Mr Jeremiah Chechick (also director of the fine Benny and Joon and the awful National Lampoons Christmas Vacation). The movie also boasts a fine English accent from Uma Thurman but a truly awful acting display not just from her but an incredibly wooden and uncharismatic performance from Ralph Fiennes.\nThis movie was so bad that Warner Bros. wouldn't even let the critics see it prior to it's theatrical release but word of mouth soon spread about how bad it was and it sunk like a stone anyway. According to Total Film Magazine the movie was originally two and a half hours long and was hacked down to a mere 89 minutes for its theatrical release after a disastrous test screening, thus making Don MacPherson's screenplay (supposedly based on Shakespeares The Tempest) make even less sense. Voted the second worst blockbuster ever made by readers of the UK's Total Film magazine, this movie didn't help anybody's career but particularly harmed Uma Thurman whose previous outing had been the sequally awful Batman and Robin.\nThe saddest thing is it could have been good and I really did want to like this.", "summary": "Sean Connery/Ralph Fiennes  Hang Your Heads In Shame", "unixReviewTime": 1005696000}

The people who developed the film were huge Avengers fans that spent years trying to bring this to the screen and saw it as an art house action movie.

Needless to say, pandering to the masses and doing good \"Avengers\" are incompatible, which the test audiences more or less told the studio execs during test screenings by not liking it at all and getting confused (though I am hard pressed to see how they were any more confused than I ended up) . Unfortunately, take out the sublime strangeness and the film falls apart and makes little sense. Apparently, the studio thought they could rush this out on name power and no real story and maybe make a little money, which is exactly how much they made.\nRegarding the film itself, it is gorgeous to look at but painful to watch. The three leads are badly miscast (You can't replace MacNee and Rigg, though Patrick Stewart and Lucy Lawless would have been MUCH more interesting than Fiennes and Thurman) and Sean Connery chews scenery like he hadn't eaten in months. would love the DVD to have loads of extras I am sure are milling about somewhere, including commentary by the director on what happened.\nStick with the TV Show.", "summary": "The story of what happened to this film", "unixReviewTime": 997920000}

I have done an extensive side-by-side comparison and the transfer is unquestionably inferior with the new set. Colors are washed out, detail and definition are reduced. It's a very stark contrast. The video bitrates are markedly higher for the old discs vs. the new. I'm noticing bitrates that are as much as 30% higher in the head-to-head comparison.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, there is for some reason a significant variation in quality from episode to episode in the new set. The last one or two episodes on each disc are consistently and inexplicably much lower in quality than the other episodes on the disc. This is not the case with the older set. Take Season 1, Disc 3 for example: it contains eight episodes, and the first six average around 1.03 GB in raw size. But the last two episodes (\"Bum Voyage\" and \"Who's Been Sleeping on My Couch?\") come in around 780-800 MB. If that 30% difference doesn't sound bad to you, trust me when I say it is very noticeable, particularly with a 40-year old series shot on film. The older discs have no such variations in quality; the same episodes in that set consistently come in around 1.09 Gb each. Size isn't always a true indicator of video quality but in this case it holds true. Many episodes in the new set  just look plain bad, like they have been through an additional transfer generation or two.\n\nHowever, the \"Complete Series\" set is the only way to get your hands on the final two seasons, so if you own the older discs, my recommendation would be to make your own set with seasons 1-4 from the season discs and 5-6 from the new set. I can't comment on the bonus features as I haven't viewed them yet. But the episode commentaries are all still here and there doesn't seem to be anything new in that department.\n\nAnother difference that may matter to you: the new set does not include subtitles, whereas the old discs have both English and Spanish subtitles. It seems Shout! Factory left them out as part of their misguided effort to cram as many episodes on each disc as possible. I'm no fan of the double-sided disc format Fox used for the season releases, and it's a pain to switch the discs more often with fewer episodes per disc, but I'll take them over the new set any day.", "summary": "A step down in video quality", "unixReviewTime": 1401321600}

Jane in the scenes with her employer is sometimes too demanding and not as tactful as she is in the book. The changes are especially obvious in Mr. Edward Rochester as he was played by Ciaran Hinds. Hinds is a talented, intense actor but I can't agree or like his reading and interpreting of Mr. Rochester's character. Some his scenes in the film made me cringe. Mr. Edward Rochester of the novel was not yelling or rather barking brute - it was difficult for me to believe that Jane Eyre would come to love so much.

I infinitely prefer the William Hurt adaptation of the novel.\n\nFirst off, the film quality and color of this film were very poor. It was washed out and altogether too bland. Also, the acting was poor in my opinion. Samantha Morton was not very believable as Jane Eyre and the actor who plays Mr. Rochester was altogether unappealing. The two actors had no spark or chemistry to speak of, and the relation of love by Mr. Rochester later in the film is wholly unbelievable and poorly delivered. He ruins one of the best lines in the novel (the one with the bit of string tied to his heart and Jane's). Also, although Mr. Rochester is not handsome, this actor was just uglier than I had imagined Mr. Rochester to be. But, that would be of little account if he also did not portray Mr. Rochester as just plain rude. He ordered about Jane in a brutish manner, levied insults, barked out his lines and was very dull. Why Jane would be attracted to him (beyond being lonely and not having the company of any other man) is beyond me. The portryal of Jane was also a dull one and her constant voice overs were really annoying. A film is supposed to show us the story, not tell us the story. There was far too much telling of Jane felt or about her past, and far too little demonstration. I was told Jane loved Mr. Rochester, but from watching the film I found that very hard to believe. Jane also seemed to be rude and disrespectful on purpose, rather than observant and forthright as she is in the novel. She doesn't mean to offend, but truthfully answers questions and speaks her mind. The movie would have you think she is just catty. Also, she always looks so annoyed with Mr. Rochester.\n\nOverall, I regret buying this film. I wished I put my $5 dollars towards the William Hurt adaptation which more accurately captures the emotion and spirit of the novel, if not all the exact details.", "summary": "Very poor movie.

First, the writers took great 'liberties' with the novel that detract, rather than enhance, the characters.  The best two examples involve the main characters of Mr. Rochester and Jane.  In the book, Rochester is a brooding, singular figure who is very much a victim of the cruel plotting and vices of others.  But in this film version, he is cruel and vindictive in and of himself.  Vengeful, plotting, and profane, you have little reason to see why Jane would ever attach herself to such a worthless creature.  Jane of course does fall in love with him, but because he is so repugnant, the viewer can hardly see any reason why.  Thus, Jane is herself reduced greatly from a woman who loves unconditionally - -as was shown in the book- -to a strange, misguided young woman racked with a codependent psyche.  The second area in which this version is inferior to the book, and the other far superior film versions (particularly the William Hurt version) is its brevity.  It is only 90 minutes long.  It leaves out so many of the small aspects that would normally give vitality and life to the characters.  Being that it is such a poor version, this is not necessarily all that bad, but willing to give the film chance after chance to redeem itself, it falls terribly short on nearly every measure.", "summary": "Definitely the Worst of the TV/Movie Adaptions", "unixReviewTime": 1041897600}

Among the scenes that were missing were the other reasons behind Jane's return to Thornfield.\nAnd then there's Samantha Morton.  I cannot think of a film where I liked her, so that is another strike against this version.\nSome have said that Timothy Dalton is \"too handsome\" to play Rochester.  Perhaps he is.  But he is such an incredible actor that I will forgive him. *grin*  I do appreciate Ciaran Hinds, and it pains me to say that I did not like him as Rochester. I read someplace that he hadn't read the book before making this film.  Well, it shows.  He rants and raves too much; there was no subtlety in his performance.

The result is that both Rochester and Jane say things that are completely out of character to anyone that's read the book. \"I feel your passions are aroused\"? I found myself screaming at the screen \"he'd never say that!\"\nMy second main objection was how Ciaran Hinds was directed to play Rochester. I blame the director because I've seen Hinds in many movies and know the range of emotion he can display. In this version he was essentially one-note: he shouts all the time. The ONLY time he softens is in the bedroom with Jane after the fire. That one scene showed me what could have been, and only sharpened my disappointment with the rest.

It made it clear that A&E Home Video had used old copies of the episodes for their remastering instead of getting new ones from the UK, undoubted a cost saving measure on their part.  As someone who has purchased many of these wonderful, older British series, I can tell you that the A&E version of the Joan Hickson \"Miss Marple\"s are not terribly good either, although they are certainly better than these sorry things.

Like most American schoolchildren, my familiarity with the crossing of the Delaware at Trenton was limited to the famous painting of that event which shows General Washington perched imperiously in the prow of a boat while being rowed through icy waters in the dead of night.  The reality was decidedly less cinematic; unfortunately, so is this made-for-television treatment.  Admittedly, I was spoiled by the superior production values of \"John Adams\" beside which this production pales.  In its favor, it does present a grittier version of life in the Continental Army than we are accustomed to seeing and does much to humanize the deified personage of its Supreme Commander.  But the production was hobbled by obvious budget constraints and prosaic camera work that make it look very like the TV project it was.  This decisive battle that turned the Revolution in the colonialists' favor is portrayed as little more than a skirmish between Washington's ragtag band of volunteers and a bunch of unsuspecting drunks.  Maybe in truth that's all it was, but the amateur look of this production does nothing to elevate the action into something a little more noble.  It appears that the fate of the Revolution hinged on little more than a brawl.  But it was a brawl the fledging nation desperately needed to win, and Washington is revealed as a crafty stratetician who was willing to risk all on a breathtaking gamble all others dimissed as insane.  The isolation of Washington's command is portrayed with numerous references to the utter lack of support for Washington from the very body that had authorized him to carry out this war.  Citizens of the Republic in the present day may take comfort (or not) in the knowledge that from its very earliest incarnation, the Congress honed its reputation as a bunch of blow-hard self-promoters who existed to endlessly debate but not to act.  Also shown is the in-fighting among Washington's generals, some of whom resented his authority and in some cases, plotted actively to undermine it.  As Washington, Jeff Daniels successfully gives the 'statue' flesh and bone.  He has a wonderful physicality for the role and looks every part the vigorous and devotion-inspiring leader in his prime.  More problematic is his delivery, which sounds too much of the contemporary Midwest (Daniels is a Michigan native) and not much at all like the 'gentleman from Virginia.'  In general, I am not in favor of American actors larding up their dialogue with distracting accents, but though Daniels looks great, he does not sound convincing as a Tidewater aristocrat.  In contrast to the mostly British supporting cast with their more elegant diction, Daniels is rough-hewn and out of his element.  He also delivers his lines very s-l-o-w-ly; one hardly thinks Washington, in the heat of battle for his life and the Republic would have been so laconic. The teleplay by Howard Fast (based on his novel of the same name) displays a tin ear for authentically colonial-sounding dialogue, with many 20th century anarchronisms creeping in, and it presents the greatest obstacle for the actors.

Some make it out okay with just the bio-pics, other played it safe and just make theirs a concert movie, but \"Spice World\" took a completely alternate step.  It's a Spice Girls power hour where a lot of zany antics occur, and nothing makes sense.\n\nI might be completely biased with this movie, because much like my unholy memories with Tom Green, the Spice Girls were also a devistating memory of youth; the thing is I used to like Tom Green while I was strongly indifferent with the girl band.  But for most of my middle school years, I'm surround by many fangirls in support of this group who play their music loudly and constantly, and I had to be the butt of a ongoing ridicule just because I made a simple comment that Ginger Spice was cute (and Geri Haliwell still looks pretty good).  My adolescent years was damaged because of the band, so reopening this mental wound does lead to personal spite.\n\nBut there are objective things to legitimately castrate this movie.  The biggest problem with the movie is that it's aimless.  The Spice Girls were setting up for a concert, they had a convenient pregnant best friend to chat with, their agent was pushing them to work hard and not have fun, and a tabloit journalist hired a sleazy paparazzo to tarnish the band because he's bored.  Everything else is practically plotless, just random scenarios that segue into other random scenarios.  They sing in different places, they meet celebrity cameos, they go on a photo shoot, two American studio execs are pitching a Spice Girls movie out of the blue, they ride on sport boats with their contest-winning fangirls, they were in a military dance camp with a stern gestappo instructor, and they were discovered by an alien race who loved their music.  There's no connection with each of these scenarios, the randomness of the goofball situations is akin to \"Family Guy\".  It also means these situations are practically idiotic in direction, if not just wordy whenever the girls just run their months about stuff only pre-teens would get into.\n\nJust to hide the fact that the Spice Girls have no acting talent, the rest of the actors have to be completely bonkers. Their agent acts like if Ari Gold popped some speed and drank a pack of red bull, the tabloit guy is pontifically British, and the studio execs are so desperately perverse when they pitch the worst ideas ever in a film, almost like a parallel to this film; the execs even ripped-off an idea from a show pilot in \"Pulp Fiction\" (Spice Force Five, get it?). Neither of them are funny, they're just pretentious, much like the movie's gags.\n\nAgain, I'm being biased.  I am not the film's audience, the audience are young impressionable girls who loved the band's songs.  This movie understood its intended audience, that's why the Spice Girls went on an S&M club, they let their pregnant friend drink alcohol, they wear revealing outfits, an alien nearly copped a feel on Scary Spice, and their agent threatened to hang himself live in concert if the band didn't show up.  But seriously, the audience for this movie is limited at this point.  It wasn't long after the movie's release that Ginger Spice followed her own independent example and left the band, which cause the foundation to crumble and the fans had to move on.  I could say the Spice Girls are gone for good (and no, I'm not counting their world tour stunt a few years back that lasted only a week), but something life has a funny way of turning things around.  If New Kids on the Block manage to get together&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/and-release-an-album-not-too-long-ago/dp/B001LN2W38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">and release an album not too long ago</a>, it's possible that this girl group would rekindle their friendship.

In addition, almost all of the action sequences are sick mockeries of reality.

But it's just ridiculous when the characters stand next to a big open hatch without getting sucked out into the sky and their hair just blows in the wind like they're standing in front of a movie studio fan.  And the most unintentionally funny moment has to be when the plane crashes-- the whole shot, one of the most awful CG effects I've seen in a big studio movie, is pathetic and kind of sad.

They play fine.\n\nReign (2013-2017) is a silly, talky, dumb version of a castle and royalty show. The scenery, locations, and costumes are beautiful, but the characters, dialog, and situations are stupid. Reign joins the ranks of other inferior castle and royalty shows such as Camelot (2011), The White Queen (2013), and World Without End (2012). If you want to read some of the many things I didn't like about Reign skip down a few paragraphs past my recommendations of better shows to watch instead of wasting your time with Reign.\n\nIf you want to see a good castle and royalty show watch Game of Thrones (2011-2019), The Last Kingdom (2015- ), Merlin (2008-2012), Pillars of the Earth (2010), The 10th Kingdom (2000), The Tudors (2007-2010), or the Vikings (2013- ).\n\nIf you're looking for good stuff to watch consider miniseries like The Astronauts Wives Club (2015), Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Frank Herberts Children of Dune (2003), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Manhattan (2014-2015), Return to Lonesome Dove (1993), Pride and Prejudice (1995), and Taken (2002), which are all terrific because they have clear beginnings that establish an objective, then strong middles and conclusive endings, like a good novel.\n\nOther shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Granite Flats (2013-2015), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lost (2004-2010), The Prisoner (1967-1968), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish.\n\nIf you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.\n\nReign began as a show about Mary, Queen of Scots. By the last season it had morphed into a show mostly not about Mary, into a show about the French Court and Queen Elizabeth of England. Meanwhile Mary was forgotten in Scotland. The last scene in the final episode of this mess is a mashup of parts of scenes from earlier seasons in the show, as if to remind viewers, Hey, remember when this was a show about Mary?\n\nReign started off with an obnoxious drumbeat, which constantly thumped in the first episode, which thankfully was toned down in the second episode and eventually went away, otherwise I wouldnt have been able to watch the whole series. The series started as a sort of a silly fashion show/music video thing, then turned into a somber show with numerous scenes of Mary crying and making silly pronouncements, during the scenes that were actually about Mary. Like some other four season series such as Farscape (1999-2003) and Enterprise (2001-2005) the first two seasons of Reign were better than the last two seasons.\n\nI liked the character Megan Follows played in Anne of Green Gables (1985), but I didn't like the despicable character she played in Reign. When Mary isn't throwing the scheming, treacherous character Follows plays into the dungeon they're hugging. Its ridiculous.\n\nOne of the many things about Reign that annoyed me was the formulaic, repetitive scene structure. The scenes were so predictable the show became boring. Heres an example of a typical scene: Two characters talk. Background music begins playing. One of the characters talks faster as the music swells into a crescendo and then the character delivers a declarative statement in a loud voice as the music reaches a climax, then flash cut to black. There are literally dozens of these repetitive scene structures in a single episode, which means there can be hundreds of them in a single season. The scenes were so predictable they put me to sleep. Slight variations of these repetitious scenes have one of the characters suddenly kiss the other character or start ripping their clothes off as the music swells to a climax, then flash cut to black.\n\nIts hard to like moronic characters. In the first episode Mary sees a girl die after eating food meant to assassinate her, Mary, Queen of Scots. Later Mary survives another attempt to poison her at the castle. Then Mary is raped. Does Mary learn? No. She constantly courts danger by forever wandering around the castle alone, into the estates, and the woods by herself, and goes sailing all by her lonesome, without guards or a single servant as an escort, so that assassins and rapists have constant access to her. She doesnt learn. She doesnt change. Shes a moron.\n\nMary, Queen of Scots, is the character viewers are supposed to care about, at least at the beginning of the series. I don't know what character the viewer was supposed to care about in the fourth and final season. After Bash (Sebastian) disappeared in the beginning of the final season I didn't care about any of the remaining characters, including Mary.", "summary": "They play fine.

While shutting down a carefully hidden webstream might be a challenge for the government or law enforcement, monetizing that type of entertainment on a large scale would be easily as challenging, making Scare Campaign one of those horror films that you are clearly not supposed to think too much about.\n\nThis Australian horror film is about a television program that pranks unsuspecting people into thinking scary horror movie type situations are actually happening to them in real life--basically Candid Camera with zombies and mad killers and such.  Similar programs have existed but without much in the way of staying power as there are only so many different scenarios you can really come up with before you run out of ideas and start repeating yourself.  Put it this way--in the last 10 years how many horror movies can you name that were completely original?\n\nScare Campaign has been on for five seasons but they are now facing competition from a group that is doing something similar, except they kill people for real.  The network boss is so excited that these psychos have 15 million subscribers that she tells the crew of Scare Campaign to up their game for the last episode of the season or they are off the air.\n\nThis one basically lost me right about then.  While one can certainly believe that the world is going to hell in a handbasket, actual snuff films as mass entertainment is still a bit too much for me to swallow unless we are talking about some kind of Mad Max post-apocalyptic future, which we're not.  The idea that a network boss thinks actual murder is a viable idea for television entertainment is also too ludicrous for me to buy, even in a horror film.\n\nThe crew for Scare Campaign try to create their scariest episode yet in an abandoned asylum, using a seemingly unstable former employee as their dupe in an effort to up the stakes.  Things go very wrong, although not in any halfway logical way that the viewer might expect.\n\nA smarter movie might have played with the idea of what's real versus what is being made up for the show, but Scare Campaign seems completely uninterested in going down that road, putting all of its eggs in the wobbly snuff film basket, so to speak.  If you can buy into the premise of Scare Campaign (or at least don't find the ideas underlying it offensively stupid) then you might enjoy the film, which is made with care in terms of the acting, direction and production values, all of which are undeniably first-rate.  Unfortunately, that leaves the script, which might have worked as satire or if the filmmakers had taken the time to create a world where snuff films as popular entertainment might seem possible.  But there's a huge difference between the popularity of horror films and people wanting to watch genuine honest to goodness torture and murder for entertainment--or at least I hope there is.  But maybe I'm being too optimistic.\n\nWriter/directors Cameron Cairnes and Colin Cairnes previously made the funny and gory 100 Bloody Acres, which makes me wonder if I somehow managed to completely miss the joke this time or if Scare Campaign is as lousy as I think.  Maybe Scare Campaign will improve upon a second viewing.  If that's the case, I will gladly rewrite this review.", "summary": "Snuff is the new mainstream horror in Scare Campaign", "unixReviewTime": 1478131200}
