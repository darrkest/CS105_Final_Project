However, for whatever undisclosed reason, at the beginning of the second season, the producers grew bored with the Crichtonesque character's status as the moral figurehead and general representative of everything that is good and decent in humanity. So, they threw the character away and replaced him with additional criminals which left the show feeling oddly anemic, given so many additional cast members to beef it up.

Strangely for season 2 all the strengths of season 1 were wittingly or unwittingly deleted.  The season starts with 2, 3, and 4 waking up in prison on the moon, separated from the other 4 main characters.  Even though 2 of the missing crew members are the 2 2 loves, neither she nor 3 or 4 even mention them during their time in prison.  Neither expressing curiosity or concern for them, nor making any effort to find them.  Even when conversing with a friend who knows what happened to them, 2 never asks about them.  Not until their (laughably easy) prison escape from the inescapable prison toward the end of episode 2, 3 remarks to 2 that they are leaving people behind, which she brushes off indifferently.  Out of pure coincidence the 3 of them run into 3 of the 4 others who were coincidentally trying to break them out of prison.\nAs the season goes on 2s mostly consistent indifference to the others and their safety, puts one characters life at risk, contributes to the death of another (later not even concerned enough to find out why he failed to return to the ship).  Most shocking, in a later episode, when evidence is presented suggesting her most trusted confidant on the ship may have been turned against them, 2 indifferently orders the others to kill the accused without confronting them with, or making any effort to verify, the evidence, then verbally ridiculing 5 when she protests this betrayal.  Bizarrely, the show runner in a interview referred to that episode as showcasing 2s strong sense of responsibility and willingness to do anything to protect the others, the exact opposite of what was actually doing in the show.  This lack of awareness of the show by those in charge, may explain why the plots often contradicted previous episodes and strengths on the series.\nAs the characters previously strong relationships and interactions in most cases seemed to be replaced with apathy.  The previously well integrated plots of season 1 were replaced sloppy writing with glaring internal holes and inconsistencies between episodes (characters forgetting what they saw two episodes earlier, or what they knew how to do several times before.  Characters motivations directly contradicting their previous consistent efforts. Etc.).  Gone were the carefully inserted throw away lines, foreshadowing future plot twists in the series like clues in a mystery novel.  Major mysteries involving the characters were mentioned, but never returned to or resolved.\nThe season as a whole felt apathetic and wandering, rather than directed or focused.  With the characters betraying one another several times, but generally not seeming to care.

Many times, such movies are not written well, therefore they fall flat and just wind up in mediocrity-hell.  But every now and then, a film comes along that surprises and entertains, yet still falls a bit short of being great.  This is the state in which I have to categorize DER BUNKER.  While I found it fun and entertaining for the most part, I felt a pang of disappointment as the film ended; not because it was over, but because so much was left unfinished.  The result has left me on the fence about my perception of the movie and how to describe it.\n\nI hate to say anything negative about this film, as it has a lot of heart and intelligence.  But in the end, I watch films for entertainment and do NOT base my opinions on artistic merit.  I know some reviewers put stock into that, but I do not for the most part.\n\nDER BUNKER is shot very well and looks great onscreen.  I like how homey the underground dwelling is made to look; in many scenes, you cannot tell the family is underground at all.\n\nThe acting is great, with Daniel Fripan stealing the show as Klaus, the 8-year old who is being groomed for our next President.  Fripan is actually a 30+ year-old man, and he definitely looks it.  The absurdity of such a casting choice is perfect here, and it makes the ridiculousness of the plot even more fun.  Fripan is joined by Pit Bukowski, who portrays his mentor.  I previously saw Bukowski in DER SAMURAI, another Artsploitation feature.  Bukowski once again does a fantastic job with his role.\n\nThe story in DER BUNKER is where I have issues.  Granted, films of this nature don't have to have much of a plot per se to be funbut this one actually opens several subplots that it never finishes.  If such effort is going to be put into them (as you will see), I feel like I need to have more information to finish them out.  Instead, we are left hanging.  **SPOILER ALERT**  (stop reading here if you do not want to know plot-points).  For example, the alien living in Klaus moms leg is never fleshed out (sorry for the pun), nor is anything ever explained about it.  Why even bring it up?  Also, the ending is too bizarre for me.  Why do Klaus mom and dad not go after him?  What 8-year old boy can fend for himself in the world?\n\nBut with these issues aside, I did enjoy DER BUNKER overall, so I suppose I can recommend it.  If you're looking for sensibility, however, I would step past this one.

Goldberg", "reviewText": "The three Brahms violin sonatas are my favourite works in this medium. They have everything you seek and expect from this towering Teutonic multidimensional master of the late romantic movement: mood, melody, and a kaleidoscope of emotions, all tightly reined in by a complex musical structure that earned this architect of notes, chords and trills the titles: Son of Beethoven and Grandson of Bach, and yet never lost his individuality and being his own man. These sonatas never sounded better than in a live performance I heard given by Maxim Vengerov, but I have also heard the present duo play them on two concert-hall occasions: in Toronto and Monte Carlo, where Anne-Sophie did not hesitate to whip her strings into a typical Brahmsian frenzy where required, as convincingly and with as much male vigour as she does on her recordings of the final movement of the Violin Concerto. Here, for some inexplicable reason, she opts for a more muted role and leaves most of the Storm und Drang to her admirable pianist. This is pretty, ladylike, and even effeminate playing, but it does nothing for the sonatas except to emasculate them of their grandeur and frequent ferocity, and the final impression conveyed to the listener is of a set of piano sonatas with violin obbligato. I am sure that this is not what Brahms had in mind, and I am equally certain that Joachim would have given him a piece of HIS mind if it were.\nIt is possible that this was a joint interpretative decision taken by both instrumentalists on this DVD. It is also possible that the entirely inappropriate boudoir setting of what is supposed to be a church library in some unidentified German state where they were asked to perform sucked all the vigour out of their playing. Could they not, in the whole of Germany, find a suitable concert hall for such an important enterprise? The fact is that Mutter plays so softly throughout, that at times, even in solo passages, she is barely audible, and when both piano and violin are playing synchronously ----- even at full belt, it is Orkis's themes that come through most clearly, while much of Mutters' remains submerged. The sound engineers should have realized what was going on and taken remedial action. They didn't. The camera cannot do much in this claustrophobic setting where both players are in danger of falling over each other. The visual arrangement is atrocious because the performing area is in the middle of a sea of pillars from which the audience fans out and is swallowed up by more corridors and pillars. Contrast this idiocy with how very much better this might have come across in a real concert setting by having a look at the Alban Berg Quartet's Beethoven series from Vienna, and Barenboim's majestic Beethoven Sonatas from the Berlin State Opera. Finally, as a sort of bonus, the two musicians discuss aspects of their longstanding professional relationship, and comment on the works they are performing within the context of the composer's turbulent life at the various times they were written. This stuff is marginally interesting, but neither player offers any charisma or excitement during what turns out to be a rather dull dialogue. Oh for a Lenny to liven things up in this department!", "summary": "Mutter plays second fiddle", "unixReviewTime": 1374105600}

Premiering After the Super Bowl on January 31st 1988, It was an immediate hit as baby boomers could not get enough of the blossoming junior high school relationship between Kevin Arnold (Fred Savage) and Winnie Cooper (Danica McKellar) in the 1960s.\n\nThere were certainly many other relationships explored on the Wonder Years featuring an amazing array of talented performers; but ultimately the show always came back to Kevin and Winnie.  As mentioned in the bonus material found on the DVD release of Season Six from Time Life, which hit shelves on September 27th; You rarely marry your childhood sweetheart.  This was a factor in making Season Six the last of the series as the characters we had come to know and love were growing up, getting ready to graduate high school, and ultimately moving on.\nYes, there could have been more seasons of The Wonder Years, but not without a new direction and ultimately a change to the innocence of the show.  After all; this was the seventies.\n\nSadly season six contains some of the weakest episodes of the series.  Knowing that the end was near and no significant changes were to be made; the writers seem to be biding their time so as to poor everything into the ending. They were successful as the final episode is one of the most poignant and emotional of the series.  Before we got to the finale, we do have to travel down some roads that don't seem to go anywhere as well as some that seem very familiar.\n\nSeason Six opened on September 23rd, 1992 with Homecoming featuring a potentially powerful tale of Waynes (Jason Hervey) best friend Wart (Scott Menville) returning from Vietnam.  This is the first sign that season six would be one filled dancing around the proverbial line.  Though there are a few powerful scenes, too much time is spent at the start of the episode catching us up on where we left off, and a side story about Kevin stealing the mascot of a rival team.  Like most of the season; we don't get enough of what we want.\n\nEpisode two features Jack (Dan Lauria) taking the boys on a fishing trip.  The episode tries too hard to make a point and leaves us wanting a subplot. Sex and Economics is reminiscent of a Happy Days episode though it does feature a guest appearance by Seth Green.  Hulk Arnold is a little too similar to Kevin going out for baseball in season three, while Poker and Kevin Delivers seem like filler as neither episodewelldelivers.\nThere are many episodes where we see elements of the relationship between Kevin and Winnie, but its not until the end that we see real growth.  In the case of the rest of the characters; watching Jack leave Norcom, and purchase his own furniture business, Wayne start dating a woman with a child, Paul (Josh Saviano) exert his independence from Kevin, and the addition of Giovanni Ribisi to the cast as one who brings a nice balance to Kevins circle of friends, are truly the best parts of season six.  Still, we are left with some questions; such as why was Wayne absent throughout the storyline of Jack leaving Norcom?  Wayne was working there at the time so the decision would seem to have impacted him.\n\nAs always; the music is great and the season six release has some of the best bonus material of the series including an enlightening interview with Executive Producer Bob Brush.\n\nRecommendation: Ultimately season six is all about the finale, and the cast and crew deliver wonderfully. Its worth buying the season just to see how the story of these Wonder Years comes to a close.

This is the original band if a bit removed from their most corrosive earliest years. Nevermind because theyve matured into excellent musicians besides being the off-kilter musical satirists still evident underneath the added polish as typified by the perfect hair-cuts.  Whats not so polished is this video is the overall quality.  Its pretty much a down and dirty Muskladen TV production wholesale.  The video quality as well as audio quality is dated.  It looks like what you might expect when VHS ruled and mono sound was the only option.  A better technical production could surely do the performance here more justice.  They say beggars cant be choosers and so it is were fortunate to have a video documentation of the band at all during their just beginning middle period.\n\nAgain, this is a video for fans mostly.  It is certainly interesting enough for others, but the songs will likely be those already acclimated to The Tubes to really bond with.  They were kind of like a San Fran bargain basement Queen.  Big guitars to be sure, but with a heavy dose of satire and kitsch that polarized their fan base.  It certainly cant be denied that within their wheelhouse these guys were more than competent musicians.  Sometimes it seemed like so many ideas struggling to get out it much was lost in craziness and little need for reigning it in to something more commercial.  Just go with it because art is where you find it seemed to be the filter these guys plowed their field in.  It definitely attracted a certain group of die-hard fans and only occasionally touched the mainstream.  That is where this concert lives.  It shows the band still on the left moving toward the center.  In that there is something special.  So, for the fan and the curious this is a recommended watch and buy.

For a medium known for its creativity and diversity it's surprising to have something so different come out of such a unique medium.\n\nMaria the Virgin Witch is the story about a witch named Maria ho lives during the Hundred Years War. She uses her magic to stop battles and keep people from killing one another. However, given that she is a witch it draws the attention of the church who condemns her actions, merely because she is a witch. From here is it a criticism of the church, God, sex, love, and salvation (among other things).\n\nAlready some people may decide if they think this premise is their kind of show or not. I will warn you (those who are indeed religious) the show has such lines as a character forgiving God for his transgressions, accusing the Archangel Michael as being nothing but a tool for God, among other things. I have heard that some people were offended by this show. I personally wasn't, but your thoughts may vary.\n\nThe DVD release\n\nFunimation did a good job with the release of this series, though it is fairly bare bones. The coolest thing is that instead of including a glossy cover for the slipcase, it is matte. Which I feel matches the overall feel of the series. The art on the covers and inside itself is all very standard and doesn't include any cool deviations or anything like the releases of Selector Infected or Dance in the Vampire Bund.\n\nThe blu-ray rip looks absolutely stunning. Not all shows have a bluray that is worth the money, but this one definitely does. The colors are sharp and visuals crisp. It's just amazing!\n\nNow for the biggest downside of this release: The bonus features. I am glad that this series has the two episodes of commentary, but other than the US trailer for this show and the textless OP, that's it. I would have liked more with the show as it really is a fascinating and introspective show, but I digress. For the price it is okay, not great, but okay.\n\nThe actual show\n\nThe animation for the show is good, not great, but good. There are definite moments of reused frames throughout the series and the action itself seems rather stilted and expressionless. This is a letdown given that Production IG are the animators. However, with a show as specific as this with an even more specific demographic, I was not expecting a huge budget for animation.\n\nThe characters themselves go from great to cardboard cutouts. The main three witches (Maria and 2 friends) are the only ones out of the group that really get any screen time, the priest is a fantastic character. Think Judge Claude Frollo in an anime. And the rest of the characters i nthe series fulfill their purpose of progressing the plot. Again, none are horrible, but only a few are great.\n\nNormally  do not address this, but I feel the fanservice in the show must be addressed. The first three episodes or so have a lot of sex jokes and nudity (I mean come on, with a title like that, what were you expecting?). I feel like these episodes were only inundated with so much fanservice because the creators knew that the show would be hard pressed to get a lot of viewers. And everyone likes boobs right? But I digress, the fanservice became too much at times which did dampen the viewing experience for me.\n\nOverall, I adore Maria the Virgin Witch. I think it is a fantastic and fascinating critique of religion and sex and hope for more anime like it in the future.", "summary": "Maria the Virgin Heretic", "unixReviewTime": 1476230400}
